# A Kind Discovery!

Black holes and Revelations

Kind's universe is unlimited, there it is countless planets and also countless life forms ,but in here we are going to explore some abstractions, and the most important for this part, recursion and some ways to work with them:

1. [Currying](./Currying.md)
2. [Nat and List Types](./Numbers.md)
3. [Recursive Algorithms](./Recursive.md)

The [Natural Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) Planet and the Pair Planet.

In our voyage we are going to have a very similar approach that we had in Kind Basics, but instead we are in a Intermediate level, the learning curve here is a little bit higher but nothing impossible, i am sure that together we can understand and work with these types, so, let's go buddy, time for us to learn more things about Constructors.
