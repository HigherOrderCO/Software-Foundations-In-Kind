# A Kind Voyage!

We are here again Kind astronaut, for a new voyage, in this Journey we are going to explore things beyond only syntax in Kind, we are going to see different types, constructors and concepts, everything is listed in the topics bellow: 

1. [Constructors with Value](./Constructors.md) - Constructors Part 2
2. [Polymorphic Types](./Polymorphic.md) - Types Part 2
3. [Accessing Constructors Values](./Accessing.md)
4. [More about Functions](./Functions.md) - Functions Part 2

In our previous exploration we went a little bit deep into the Boolean planet, now we are going to explore some complex Life Forms, the Maybe and Pair Planet.

In our voyage we are going to have a very similar approach that we had in Kind Basics, but instead we are in a Intermediate level, the learning curve here is a little bit higher but nothing impossible, i am sure that together we can understand and work with these types, so, let's go buddy, time for us to learn more things about Constructors.
