# Learning Kind Basics

A quick guide for new recruits.

If this is your first time studying Kind, it may take some time to get used with its syntax and other details. So, before exploring this vast Universe, take a look in these eight topics:

- [Terminal](./Terminal.md);
- [Installation](./Installation.md);
- [Text Editors](./IDE.md);
- [Hello Kind!](./Hello.md) (A Hello Kind Guide);
- [Types](../Basic/Types.md) - Part 1;
- [Constructors](../Basic/Constructors.md) - Part 1;
- [Functions](../Basic/Functions.md) - Part 1;
- [Type Checker](../Basic/TypeChecker.md);

They are necessary to better understand deeper contexts as we proceed towards our goal. After some preparation to start the journey, you'll have a first contact with the basic about Functions and how to build some of them, Boolean Logics, working with Bool types and constructors.

This learning method was tested before with many other Kind Astronaut Recruits, generating data about the best outcome and learning curve. Hoping that you feel comfortable with this approach, welcome to Kind Basics!
