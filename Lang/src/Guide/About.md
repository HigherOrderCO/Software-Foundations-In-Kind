# About Kind

Kind aims to be more practical and conventional-like as a language. It is statically typed, and its types are so powerful that you can even prove mathematical theorems with them.

A possible description for Kind is to imagine it as the Universe when you try to capture an image of it from the outside. When you create a new file in Kind, it's like the whole Universe is there except the piece you're looking for is not specified.

Ok, it is weird to think about the universe from the outside, it can get a bit confusing, so let's use a little story to better understand it:

 *We are Astronauts, Kind Astronauts. One day, in this fruitful little exploration, our spaceship comes across a planet that already has a name: "Boolean Logics". In this planet, we discover the functions "AND", "NOT" and "OR", and then decide to formally prove those beings. With all proved and documented, we have a hard time finding another Boolean logic function. Therefore, by thinking "our job is done", we jump back into the Kind Spaceship to look for new planets to explore.*

 *Nonetheless, a few days later there are news all over the universe, people are talking about other new types of functions discovered in planet Boolean Logics: "XOR", "NAND"  and "XNOR". Just before our departure from the planet, another Kind astronaut arrived there and encountered those new functions.*

 *Even with all the work, we couldn't find those functions the other astronaut did. But they were there. So, just because a function has not been discovered yet, it doesn't mean that it didn't exist before.*

Above, the [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) Type is used to better elucidate our example. It is like a planet in our Universe, and its Definitions and Functions are the Biome and Ecosystem from the planet.  

This Kind Universe is as big as your imagination, in fact, it is probably bigger than that. There are endless planets, ecosystems and biomes to explore. With that in mind, would you like to become a Kind Astronaut and embark in this fun (and not that perilous) adventure with many other astronauts?

If you don't like the idea of exploring the Universe, it's okay, we could use another analogy, a shorter and easy one. Just imagine Kind Lang as a Book Recipe, an empty one, with an endless amount of ingredients, and as long as you can find recipes you can write in the recipe book for other people to use.
