## Exercises

Prove the following using induction. You may need previously proven results.

```rust,ignore
Mult_0_r (n: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Mult n Nat/zero) Nat/zero
Mult_0_r n = ?

Plus_n_sm (n: Nat/) (m: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Nat/succ (Plus n m)) (Plus n (Nat/succ m))
Plus_n_sm n m = ?

Plus_comm (n: Nat/) (m: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Plus n m) (Plus m n)
Plus_comm n m = ?

Add_0_r (n: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Plus n Nat/zero) n
Add_0_r n = ?

Plus_assoc (n: Nat/) (m: Nat/) (p: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Plus n (Plus m p)) (Plus (Plus n m) p)
Plus_assoc n m p = ?
```

Consider the following function that doubles its input.

```rust,ignore
Double (n: Nat/)     : Nat/
Double Nat/zero     = Nat/zero
Double (Nat/succ n) = Nat/succ (Nat/succ (Double n))
```

Use induction to prove the following theorems about ``Double``:

```rust,ignore
Double_plus (n: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Double n) (Plus n n)
Double_plus n = ?
```

Some theorems require analyzing the best way to prove them, for example, to prove that a number is even, we could prove it for its successor, but that would require us to prove it for the successor of the successor, making the proof of ``Evenb`` more difficult by induction. So it's important to realize when it is necessary and when it is not.

```rust,ignore
Evenb_s (n: Nat/) : Equal/ Bool/ (Evenb (Nat/succ n)) (Notb  (Evenb n))
Evenb_s n = ?
```

## Another case

Let's verify if the equality ``n +(m + 1) = 1 + (n + m)`` is true.

First, our problem:

```rust,ignore
Problems.t2 (n: Nat/) (m: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Plus n (Nat/succ m)) (Nat/succ (Plus n m))
```

We verify the base case, when ``n`` is zero:

```rust,ignore
Problems.t2 Nat/zero m = Equal/refl
```

and move on to the next case

```rust,ignore
Problems.t2 (Nat/succ n) m = ?
```

and our current goal becomes:

```rust,ignore
• Expected: Prop.Equal Data.Nat (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n (Data.Nat.succ m))) (Data.Nat.succ (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n m)))
```

Translating, the successor of the addition of ``n`` and the successor of ``m`` is equal to the successor of the successor of the addition of ``n`` and ``m``. To solve this problem, we will invoke induction:

```rust,ignore
let ind = Problems.t2 n m
```

and our current goal is to prove that:

```rust,ignore
• Expected: Prop.Equal Data.Nat (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n (Data.Nat.succ m))) (Data.Nat.succ (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n m)))
```

Again, translating, that the ``successor`` of the addition of ``n`` and the ``successor`` of ``m`` is equal to the ``successor`` of the ``successor`` of the addition of ``n`` and ``m``.

But now we have a very useful tool, our variable ind which is:

```rust,ignore
Equal/ Nat/ (Plus n (Nat/succ m)) (Nat/succ (Plus n m))
```

Now, analyzing our goal and our variable ind, we can see that it is enough to add ``Nat.succ`` to both sides of the induction, and it will be exactly the same as our goal. To do this, we will use a ``lambda`` function:

```rust,ignore
let app = Equal/apply (x => (Nat/succ x)) ind
```

And our variable ``app`` will return our goal:

```rust,ignore
Equal/ Nat/ (Nat/succ (Plus n (Nat/succ m))) (Nat/succ (Nat/succ (Plus n m)))
```

Just return app and Kind will give us the coveted ``All terms check``.

# Using other theorems

In Kind, as in informal mathematics, large proofs are often divided into a sequence of theorems, with later proofs referring to earlier theorems. But sometimes a proof will require some varied fact that is too trivial and of too little general interest to give it its own higher-level name. In these cases, it is convenient to be able to simply state and prove the necessary "sub-theorem" exactly at the point where it is used.

Let's analyze the following addition commutation theorem:

```rust,ignore
Problems.t3 (n: Nat/) (m: Nat/) : Equal/ Nat/ (Plus n  m) (Plus m n)
```

In the first case, for ``n`` and ``m`` equal to zero we have a reflection:

```rust,ignore
Problems.t3 Nat/zero Nat/zero = Equal/refl
```

So we move on to the next case:

```rust,ignore
Problems.t3 (Nat/succ n) m = ?
```

And here it seems that we have a new problem:

```rust,ignore
Expected: Prop.Equal Data.Nat (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n m)) (Plus m (Data.Nat.succ n))

```

Analyzing the problem, we realize that there is a theorem already proven within it, that the ``successor`` of the addition of two numbers is equal to the addition of one number with its ``successor``, so we can use that to our advantage.

We will start by applying a ``Nat.succ`` to our original problem:

```rust,ignore
let ind_a = Equal/apply (x => (Nat/succ x)) (Problems.t3 n m )
```

Then we invoke our already solved problem, ``Problems.t2``:

```rust,ignore
let ind_b = Problems.t2 m n
```

When we give the ``Type Check``, the terminal returns:

```diff
+ INFO  Inspection.

   • Expected: (Equal Nat (Nat.succ (Plus n m)) (Plus m (Nat.succ n))) 

   • Context: 
   •   n     : Nat 
   •   m     : Nat 
   •   ind_a : (Equal Nat (Nat.succ (Plus n m)) (Nat.succ (Plus m n))) 
   •   ind_a = (Equal.apply Nat Nat (Plus n m) (Plus m n) (x => (Nat.succ x)) (Problems.t3 n m)) 
   •   ind_b : (Equal Nat (Plus m (Nat.succ n)) (Nat.succ (Plus m n))) 
   •   ind_b = (Problems.t2 m n) 
 
   let ind_b = Problems.t2 m n
     ?
     ┬
     └Here!
```

Now we can see that the first part of ``ind_a`` is the inverse of the first part of our goal and the first part of ``ind_b`` is equal to the second part of the goal, we just need to organize and join the necessary parts. To do this, we will use ``Equal.mirror`` and ``Equal.chain``.

```rust,ignore
let ind_c = Equal/chain ind_b Equal/mirror ind_a
```

And ``ind_c`` returns a value similar to the desired one:

```rust,ignore
• Expected: Prop.Equal Data.Nat (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n m)) (Plus m (Data.Nat.succ n))
•   ind_c : Prop.Equal Data.Nat (Plus m (Data.Nat.succ n)) (Data.Nat.succ (Plus n m))
```

We can see that one is the other mirrored, to make them equal, we will use ``Equal.mirror`` again:

```rust,ignore
let app = Equal/mirror ind_c
```

When we call ``app``, the ``Type Check`` returns the message ``All terms checked`` and thus we prove, through induction and using another proof, the commutation of addition, that the sum of ``n`` and ``m`` is equal to the sum of ``m`` and ``n``.
