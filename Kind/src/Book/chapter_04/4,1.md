## Number Lists

Generalizing the definition of pairs, we can describe the type of number lists as follows: "A list is either the empty list or a set of one element and another list", this type is not composed of a ``head`` and a ``tail``.

```rust,ignore
type List (t) {
  nil
  cons (head: t) (tail: List t)
}
```

As we are dealing with only one type, it is interesting to rewrite the list type for a defined one, the chosen one was ``Nat``:

```rust,ignore
type NatList {
  nil
  cons (head: Nat) (tail: NatList)
}
```

or

```rust,ignore
type NatList {
   List Nat
}
```

We can see that in both notations, there is a ``head`` and a ``tail``, with the
``head`` receiving an element of type ``Nat`` and the ``tail`` receiving a list of type ``Nat``.

For example, a list of three natural numbers 1n, 2n, and 3n would be written as follows:

`[1n, 2n, 3n]`

However, the Kind reads it differently:

`[1n, [2n, 3n]]`

where ``1n`` is the head and ``[2n, 3n]`` is the tail. Likewise, looking at a
list of 4 elements ``[1n, 2n, 3n, 4n]``, we now see it as follows:

`[1n, [2n, [3n, 4n]]]`

The list has the ``head`` ``1n`` and the ``tail`` ``[2n, [3n, 4n]]``, which, in turn, has the
``head`` ``2n`` and the ``tail`` ``[3n, 4n]`` which also has its ``head`` ``3n`` and its ``tail`` ``4n``.

It may seem scary, but it's a friendly monster:

### Repeat

The function ``repeat`` takes a number ``n`` and a value, returning a list of size ``n`` where all elements are the declared value.

```rust,ignore
// Exemplo: (Repeat 3 Bool.true) -> [True, True, True]
Repeat (x: Nat) (count: Nat) : List Nat
Repeat x Nat.zero            = [] 
Repeat x (Nat.succ count)    = List.cons Nat x (Repeat count x)
```

### Length

The function ``length`` calculates the size of the list.

```rust,ignore
// Exemplo: (Length [1,2,3]) -> 3
Length (xs: List Nat) : Nat
Length List.nil              = 0n
Length (List.cons head tail) = (Nat.succ (Length tail))
```

### Concat

The function ``concat`` concatenates (appends) two lists.

```rust,ignore
Concat (xs: List Nat) (ys: List Nat) : List Nat
Concat (List.nil)            ys = ys
Concat (List.cons head tail) ys = List.cons Nat head (Concat tail ys)
```

### Head and Tail

The head function returns the first element (the "head") of the list, while tail returns everything except the first element (the "tail"). Of course, an empty list has no first element, so we must handle this case with a ``Maybe`` type, receiving a ``Maybe.none`` if the list is empty or a ``Maybe.some`` if it has a value.

```rust,ignore
// Exemplo: (Head 0n [1n,2n,3n]) -> 1n
Head (default: Nat) (xs: List Nat) :  Nat
Head default (List.nil)            = default
Head default (List.cons head tail) = head
```

```rust,ignore
// Exemplo: (Tail Nat [1,2,3]) -> [2,3]
Tail (xs: List Nat)        : List Nat
Tail (List.nil)            = []
Tail (List.cons head tail) = tail
```

```rust,ignore
Test_head1 : Equal Nat (Head 0n [1n,2n,3n]) 1n
Test_head1 = Equal.refl
```

```rust,ignore
Test_head2 : Equal Nat (Head 0n List.nil) 0n
Test_head2 = Equal.refl
```

```rust,ignore
Test_head3 : Equal (List Nat) (Tail [1n, 2n, 3n]) [2n, 3n]
Test_head3 = Equal.refl
```

#### Theorem
