# Data Structures

## Lists : Working with Structured Data

From now on, we will see structured data, especially lists and pairs, which can contain elements of various types. In the type definition, we will already show them with ``polymorphic`` types, but don't worry, we will talk about it in the next chapter. For now, let's just ignore the type and follow the explanation. It will make more sense as we progress in our study.

### Data Structures

In an inductive type definition, each constructor can receive any number of arguments -- none like ``Bool``, ``Empty``, or one like ``Nat`` -- and we have the ``Pair`` that receives two arguments (which can even be other two pairs) and returns a type:

```rust,ignore
record Pair (a) (b) 
```

The two received arguments are transformed into the first component, ``fst``, and the second, ``snd``.

```rust,ignore
record Pair (a) (b) {
  fst : a
  snd : b
} 
```

The way to construct a pair of ``Nat`` is as follows:

```rust,ignore
Pair.new Nat Nat a b  : (Pair a b)
```

Here are two simple functions to extract the first and second components of a pair. The definitions also illustrate how to pattern match on two constructor arguments.

```rust,ignore
Fst (pair: Pair Nat Nat) : Nat
Fst (Pair.new Nat Nat fst snd) = fst
```

```bash
Example 1: (Fst Nat (List Nat) (Pair 2n [1n,2n,3n])) ->  2n
```

```rust,ignore
Snd (pair: Pair Nat Nat) : Nat
Snd (Pair.new Nat Nat fst snd) = snd
```

```bash
Example 2: (Snd Nat (List Nat) (Pair 2n [1n,2n,3n])) -> [1n,2n,3n]
```

#### Some proofs

Let's try to prove some simple facts about pairs. If we declare things in a particular (and slightly peculiar) way, we can complete proofs with just reflexivity:

```rust,ignore
Surjective_pairing (p: Pair Nat Nat) : Equal (Pair Nat Nat) p (Pair.new (Fst p) (Snd p))
Surjective_pairing (Pair.new Nat Nat fst snd) = Equal.refl
```

But ``Equal.refl`` is not enough if the statement is:

```rust,ignore
Surjective_pairing (Pair.new Nat Nat fst snd) = Equal.refl
```

Since Kind expects

```rust,ignore
Equal (Pair Nat Nat) p (Pair.new (Fst p) (Snd p))
```

And received

```rust,ignore
Equal p p
```

We must "expose" the internal structure of the ``pair`` so that the ``Type Checker`` can verify whether ``p`` is really equal to ``Pair.new (Fst p) (Snd p)``.

#### Snd_fst_is_swap

```rust,ignore
Snd_fst_is_swap (p: Pair Nat Nat ) : Equal (Pair Nat Nat) (Pair.swap Nat Nat (Pair.swap Nat Nat p) p)
Snd_fst_is_swap (Pair.new Nat Nat fst snd) = ? 
```

#### Fst_swap_is_snd

```rust,ignore
Fst_swap_is_inverse (p: Pair Nat Nat) (a: Nat) (b: Nat) : Equal (Pair Nat Nat) (Pair.swap Nat Nat (Pair.new a b) (Pair.new b a))
Fst_swap_is_inverse p a b = ?
```
