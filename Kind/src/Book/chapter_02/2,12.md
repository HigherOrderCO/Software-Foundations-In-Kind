#### Boolean_functions

Use the knowledge taught so far to solve the theorem:

```rust,ignore
Identity_fn_applied_twice (f: Bool -> Bool) (e: (x: Bool) -> Equal Bool (f x) x) (b : Bool) : Equal Bool (f (f b)) b
Identity_fn_applied_twice f e b = ?
```

Then, solve the ``negation_fn_applied_twice`` theorem, which is the same as the previous one, but changing the hypothesis to ``Equal (f x) (Not x)``

#### Andb_eq_orb

Prove the following theorem (Remember that you can prove intermediate theorems separately):

```rust,ignore
Andb_eq_orb (b: Bool) (c: Bool) (e: Equal Bool (Andb b c) (Orb b c)) : Equal Bool b c
Andb_eq_orb b c prf = ?
```

#### Binary

Consider a different representation of natural numbers using a binary system instead of unary. That is, instead of having only zero or one successor of a number, we can have:

* zero;
* twice a number;
* twice a number plus 1.

1. First, write an inductive definition of this type, calling it ``Bin``. (Remember that, in essence, the definition of ``Nat`` as ``zero`` or ``succ n`` has no intrinsic meaning. It only says that an element of ``Nat`` can be a ``zero`` or a s``ucc n`` if ``n`` is also ``Nat``. The interpretation of this as a system of values 0, 1, 2, etc., comes from how we work with this type ``Nat``. Your definition of ``Bin`` ideally will be as simple as well. It will be the functions you make on ``Bin`` that will give mathematical sense to it).
2. Then write an ``Incr`` function to increment a ``Bin``, and a ``Bin_to_nat`` function to convert from ``Bin`` to ``Nat``.
3. Write five proofs that test your increment and conversion functions. Note that incrementing a binary and then converting it should result in the same result as converting it first and then incrementing the ``Nat``.
