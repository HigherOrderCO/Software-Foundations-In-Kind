## Enumerated Types

An unusual aspect of Kind, similar to other proof languages such as Idris and Coq, is that its built-in toolset is quite small. For example, instead of providing the usual range of primitive types (booleans, lists, strings, etc), Kind has only two primitive types (U60: unsigned 60-bit binary integers) and (F60: unsigned 60-bit binary floating point numbers) and offers a powerful mechanism for defining new data types from scratch, from which all these familiar types and more can be derived.

To demonstrate how the definition mechanism works, let's start with a simple example.

<!-- TODO Esse bloco de texto serÃ¡ relevante quando tivermos um sistema de pacotes apropriado -->
<!-- Naturally, the Idris distribution comes with extensive standard libraries providing
definitions of booleans, numbers, and many common data structures like lists and
hash tables (see the prelude and contrib packages), as well as the means to write
type-safe effectful code (see the effects package) and pruvlioj, a toolkit for proof
automation and program construction. But there is nothing magic or primitive
about these library definitions. To illustrate this, we will explicitly recapitulate
all the definitions we need in this course, rather than just getting them implicitly
from the library. -->
