## Types of functions

All expressions in Kind have a type, describing what type of thing it computes.
For example, `Bool.true` has type `Bool`, just like `Notb Bool.true` also has type ``Bool``.

Functions like ``Notb``, before they receive arguments, also have a type, just like `Bool.true` or ``Bool.false``.
Their types are called Function Types, and are denoted with arrows.

``Notb``, for example, would be denoted as ``Bool -> Bool``, which can be read as
"a function that takes a ``Bool`` as input and returns a value of type ``Bool``".
Similarly, the type of the ``Andb`` function is ``Bool -> Bool -> Bool``, meaning
"a function that takes two arguments of type ``Bool`` and returns a value of type ``Bool``".
