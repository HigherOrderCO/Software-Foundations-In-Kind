# Hello Kind!

Now that you have learned how to create and run a Kind file, let's dive deeper into the basics of Kind. In the next section, you will learn about Kind's type system, syntax, variables, and functions.

#### Kind's Type System

Kind has a static type system, which means that the type of a variable must be known at compile-time. Kind has a rich type system that includes primitive types, algebraic data types, and type parameters.

#### Kind Syntax

Kind's syntax is inspired by functional programming languages like Haskell. The syntax is concise and expressive, making it easy to read and write code. It uses indentation instead of braces to define blocks of code.

#### Variables

In Kind, variables are declared using the keyword let followed by the variable name. For example:

```
let x = 42
```

#### Functions

Functions in Kind are declared using the first letter capitalized. The function may take parameters or not and returns a value. For example:

```
Nat.add (a: Nat) (b: Nat) : Nat
```

This is just a brief overview of the basics of Kind. You will learn more about these concepts as you progress through the guide. Now that you have learned about Kind's basics, it's time to move on to the next section and learn about advanced concepts in Kind programming.
